# Usage
Before importing, please be sure to uncomment/comment the proper regional labels for your ROM.

To import these successfully into EoS via SkyTemple (on 1.3+), first apply the ExtractMoveCode patch in *ASM Patches -> Utility*. Once the ROM is reloaded, you can edit the game's moves under *Moves -> Move Effects*. When importing a new move, you can choose to replace an effect or add a new one in the *Effects Code* tab with the "+" button. Next, click on *Import Code* and select any ".asm" file. In the *Move Effects* tab, assign a move to the effect of the imported file.

Once the ROM is saved, the move should work!
