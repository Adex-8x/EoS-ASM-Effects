# EoS-ASM-Effects
This repository contains my ASM effects (moves and special processes) for EoS! Unless directly specified in the file name, all of these effects are compatible with the US and EU versions.
# Credits
- **Capypara:** Creating [SkyTemple](https://skytemple.org)!
- **End45:** Providing various functions, code revisions, and generally being a big help!
- **Irdkwia:** Providing various functions, templates to create ASM effects, most of the patches necessary to import/export effects, and generally being a big help!
- **Techticks:** Creating [ASMEditor](https://asmeditor.skytemple.org), a GUI to code item and move effects in EoS!
- **UsernameFodder:** Releasing their [Dungeon RAM research notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Q_7BGmNx5wJtJ9iJEwlK1WITjiCcEQxE9C82RECJbg/edit?usp=sharing), which made most (if not all) of these move effects possible!
- Anyone reading this! :)
