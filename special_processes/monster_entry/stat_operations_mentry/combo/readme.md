# Usage
**Important!** Call Irdkwia's ["Remove Party" process](https://github.com/SkyTemple/eos-move-effects/blob/master/example/process/remove_party.asm) before using these! Be sure to call a team setup process afterwards!

### What is a Combo Process?
Combo processes are a way of chaining special processes together to pass more than two arguments! In this case, all of the combo processes regarding Chimecho Assembly entries rely on Irdkwia's ["Select ID" process](https://github.com/SkyTemple/eos-move-effects/blob/master/example/process/combos/select_id.asm), which must be called immediately before calling any of these processes!
